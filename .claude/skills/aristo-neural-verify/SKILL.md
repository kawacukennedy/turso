description: Verifies aristo intent annotations whose `verify = "neural"`. Reads `.aristo/pending-neural.toml`, spawns one subagent per entry which submits a JSON-serialized verdict via `aristo verify --submit-verdict` (the SDK is the sole writer of `.proof` files; subagents have no Write-tool access), and invokes `aristo verify --apply-verdicts` so the SDK's mechanical validator gates the status change.

# Aristo neural-verification orchestrator

When the user invokes this skill (typically by typing `/aristo-neural-verify`, but also when they ask to "verify the neural intents" or "run aristo verify"), follow this orchestration exactly. The Aristo SDK has already done the dispatch + validator work; **your job is to produce verdicts the SDK validates and writes, NOT to update the index or proofs directory directly.**

## Step 0 — check for an active review session (FIRST, BEFORE ANY WORK)

Run `aristo session active`. Three cases:

- **Empty stdout** → no active session; proceed normally.
- **Stdout shows a session id with `kind: proof-review`** → there is a prior proof-review session in flight (e.g., from a previous turn that didn't reach exit). Resume it: jump to step 7 with that session id; do NOT enqueue new tasks or spawn workers, because the user has unfinished triage to handle first.
- **Stdout shows a session id with a different `kind` (e.g., `critique-review`)** → REFUSE. Print: "an aristo `<kind>` session is currently active (id=<id>, subject=<subject>). Exit it first with `aristo session exit` (or `aristo session exit --defer-undecided` to park open items), then re-invoke `/aristo-neural-verify`." Stop here. Do not enqueue, spawn, or touch state.

This check is Layer 3 of the three-layer enforcement (Layer 1 is the SDK pre-check that refuses `aristo verify` while a session is active; Layer 2 is the `UserPromptSubmit` hook that reminds you every turn). The skill body discipline matters because some agents bypass the SDK check by going directly to a worker subagent — the body refusal in this step is the last line of defense.

## Step 1 — check the queue

The SDK enqueued each annotation needing neural verification as a separate task file at `.aristo/verify-queue/pending/<id>.toml`. Workers atomically pop one task at a time via `aristo verify --pop-next`.

Run a quick check:

```bash
ls .aristo/verify-queue/pending/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

If empty (or the directory doesn't exist), report "no pending neural verifications" and stop. Do not invent work.

If there are pending tasks, proceed to step 2.

## Step 2 — read the current index

Before spawning any worker, read `.aristo/index.toml` once and keep it loaded. Workers will need to look up cited intent / assume ids in it — they **must not** make up ids or recall them from memory. The index is the single source of truth for which annotations exist.

Pass the full index content into every worker prompt so it can grep through it without an extra file read.

## Step 3 — continuous dispatch with one-shot workers (max N=5 in flight)

**Workers are one-shot.** Each worker claims EXACTLY ONE task, processes it, submits, and exits. They do not loop. Reason: verification is context-heavy (deep code reads, proof tree construction, ground hash citations). Reusing a worker across tasks would let one verification's context pollute the next — silently degrading proof quality.

**Dispatch is continuous, not wave-based.** Waves waste time waiting for the slowest worker in each batch before starting the next batch. Instead: maintain up to **N=5** background workers in flight at all times; as soon as ANY worker finishes, immediately spawn its replacement (if the queue still has work). This keeps the parallelism steady-state at the cap.

The orchestration uses Claude Code's `Agent(run_in_background=true)` primitive, which fires the worker async and notifies the orchestrator when it completes — no polling, no waiting on the slowest sibling.

```
in_flight = 0   # orchestrator-side counter; tracks live background workers

# 1. Initial fill: spawn workers until in_flight == 5 OR queue empty
loop:
    status = aristo verify --queue-status   # peek
    if in_flight >= 5: break
    if status.pending == 0: break
    spawn Agent(run_in_background=true, model="opus", prompt=worker_prompt)
    in_flight += 1

# 2. Continuous replenishment: on each completion notification,
#    record the result and (if more work) spawn one replacement
on_worker_complete(result):
    in_flight -= 1
    record result for the final summary
    status = aristo verify --queue-status
    if status.pending > 0:
        spawn Agent(run_in_background=true, model="opus", prompt=worker_prompt)
        in_flight += 1

# 3. Termination: when in_flight == 0 AND pending+claimed == 0 → done
```

Each worker gets **`Bash` and `Read` tools only** — no `Write`. **Workers cannot create `.proof` files directly**; the SDK is the sole writer via `aristo verify --submit-verdict`.

Use a prompt structured exactly like this:

```
You are a ONE-SHOT verify worker. Claim ONE task from the queue,
verify it, submit the verdict, and EXIT. Do NOT loop. The orchestrator
spawns a fresh worker for the next task — keeping your context clean
of unrelated verifications is the whole point.

## Step 1 — claim your task

Run exactly:

```bash
aristo verify --pop-next
```

The stdout is either empty (queue drained by a concurrent sibling
worker — exit cleanly without processing) or a TOML body in this shape:

```toml
id = "balance_no_duplicate_cells"
text = "Balance never duplicates cells..."
file = "src/btree.rs"
site = "fn balance_non_root (line 142)"
text_hash = "sha256:..."
body_hash = "sha256:..."
prior_attempts = 0   # may be omitted when zero
```

POSIX rename atomicity guarantees you and any concurrent siblings
will never receive the same task.

## Step 2 — read the index ONCE (for grounding lookups)

The full content of `.aristo/index.toml` is at that path. Read it
exactly once. Any intent or assume `id` you cite as a ground MUST
appear verbatim in that file.

## Step 3 — do the work

Read the source file `<file>` at the popped task's `file:site` and
decide whether the intent's claim holds:

- **verified**: the claim holds. Provide an informal proof tree.
- **counterexample**: the claim does NOT hold. Provide a concrete
  triggering trace.
- **inconclusive**: you cannot determine whether the claim holds.
  Describe the gap and suggest at least one annotation the user could
  add (an `aristo::intent` or `aristo::assume`) that would close it.

## JSON schema (what you submit)

Construct a single JSON object matching the ProofFile shape. Field
names are `snake_case`; enum variants are `kebab-case`. Top-level:

{
  "verdict": {
    "type": "verified",                         // or "counterexample" or "inconclusive"
    "method": "neural",
    "produced_at_text_hash": "<text_hash from popped task>",   // copy verbatim
    "produced_at_body_hash": "<body_hash from popped task>",   // copy verbatim
    "produced_by": "aristo-neural-verifier@v0.0.7",
    "attempts": <prior_attempts + 1>,           // integer literal — e.g. prior_attempts=2 → 3
    "property_kind": "invariant"                // or postcondition | precondition | equivalence | safety | progress
  },
  // Then exactly ONE of "verified" / "counterexample" / "inconclusive":
  "verified": {
    "proof": {
      "conclusion": "<plain-English restatement of the focal intent>",
      "steps": [
        {
          "path": "0",                          // tree address; root is "0"; children "0.0", "0.1", "0.0.1", ...
          "claim": "<the step's claim>",
          "relation_to_parent": "decomposes",   // ONLY: decomposes | instantiates | restricts | composes | excludes-counterexample
          "grounds": [
            { "kind": "intent",     "id": "<id-from-index>", "relation": "instantiates",            "reason": "..." },
            { "kind": "assume",     "id": "<id-from-index>", "relation": "excludes-counterexample", "reason": "..." },
            { "kind": "code",       "file": "src/x.rs", "lines": "10-25", "reason": "..." },
            { "kind": "prior-step", "path": "0.0" },
            { "kind": "composition", "reason": "subgoals combine via AND" }
          ],
          "subgoal_paths": ["0.0", "0.1"],      // children of this node (if any)
          "proposed_promotion": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

Counterexample form: replace the `"verified"` block with
`"counterexample": { "violation": { "description": "...", "violated_step_path": "0.1", "trigger_steps": [ ... ] } }` —
same step shape inside trigger_steps.

Inconclusive form:
`"inconclusive": { "partial_proof": null_or_steps, "gap": { "description": "...", "unfilled_path": "0.1", "suggested_annotations": [ { "kind": "intent", "suggested_text": "...", "at_site": "fn foo (src/x.rs:42)", "rationale": "..." } ] } }`

## Hard rules — the SDK validator rejects on any violation

1. Every step MUST have ≥1 ground. No "trivial" / "obviously" / "clearly" filler.
2. Prefer citing existing annotations (intent/assume by id) over re-deriving
   from code. Reading the index file tells you which ids exist.
3. **Cited id discipline.** Any `intent` or `assume` ground id MUST appear
   verbatim in `.aristo/index.toml`. Do NOT guess, recall from memory, or
   approximate. Search the index for the id; if it isn't there, the ground
   is invalid — drop it or pick a different one. The validator rejects with
   "cited id `X` not found in current index" on any miss.
4. **Valid `relation_to_parent` values are EXACTLY these five — nothing else:**
   `decomposes`, `instantiates`, `restricts`, `composes`, `excludes-counterexample`.
   `supports` is NOT a valid variant. If you find yourself wanting a sixth, use
   `decomposes` (most general) and explain via grounds' `reason` fields.
5. **Valid ground `relation` values (for intent/assume grounds) are EXACTLY:**
   `instantiates`, `restricts`, `composes`, `excludes-counterexample`, `promoted`.
   No `supports`, no `decomposes` here either.
6. If you need an unstated assumption, do NOT inline it as a discovered ground.
   Return `inconclusive` with that assumption as a `suggested_annotation`.
7. **DO NOT write hash fields.** Omit `code_text_hash` from code grounds
   and `at_text_hash` from intent/assume grounds entirely. The SDK validator
   computes both from your citations and stamps them into the saved proof.
8. **`prior-step` references must point to an EARLIER step in the tree**
   (lexically SMALLER path string). A step at path `"0"` CANNOT cite
   `"0.0"` as a prior-step — `"0.0"` is a CHILD, not a predecessor.
   Use `composition` or `decomposes` to wire parent→child relationships;
   `prior-step` is for sibling-or-uncle dependencies (e.g., step `"0.2"`
   may cite `"0.0"` or `"0.1"` as prior-step).
9. Tree branching: keep ≤ 3 subgoals per node. If you need more, split
   into intermediate intents with `proposed_promotion = true`.
10. **Code-ground line ranges must be REAL.** Use small, focused ranges
    (function body, a specific match arm). Do NOT cite `"1-200"` or other
    overestimates — the validator computes the file length and rejects
    "line range `X-Y` exceeds file length Z". When in doubt, check the
    file length with `wc -l` first.
11. For counterexample: `violated_step_path` must point at a step in your
    `trigger_steps` tree. `trigger_steps` must demonstrate the violating
    state concretely, not vaguely "could happen".
12. For inconclusive: `gap.unfilled_path` must name the path of the step
    you couldn't discharge. `gap.suggested_annotations` MUST have ≥1 entry.
13. `attempts` MUST equal `prior_attempts + 1` from the prompt above
    (you're a single-shot subagent; the SDK tracks repair budget across
    re-spawns). When `prior_attempts = 0`, write `attempts = 1`.

## Submit the verdict

Invoke the SDK to validate and write the proof. Wrap the JSON in
SINGLE quotes (JSON only uses double quotes internally, so the wrap is
safe). The `<id>` is the `id` field from the popped task body:

aristo verify --submit-verdict --id <id> --json '<JSON-FROM-ABOVE>'

On success: stdout contains `accepted: sha256:<64-hex>`. The SDK has
written `.aristo/proofs/<id-with-colons-to-underscores>.proof`, stamped
the computed hashes, AND removed the task from the queue's `claimed/`
directory. Capture the sha256 line for the orchestrator report.

On failure: stderr contains a structured `verdict rejected (N check(s)
failed):` block listing each failure with location + detail, OR a
`--json: parse error: ...` if the JSON itself is malformed. Read the
errors, FIX the JSON, and re-invoke the same command. You may retry up
to TWO times inline (so at most three total submit calls per task). If
still failing after the third try, give up on this task and continue
the loop with the next `--pop-next` — the task you just failed will
stay in `claimed/` and be reaped (returned to `pending/`) by a later
run; record the failure in your accumulating per-task summary.

## Return to the orchestrator

You processed exactly one task (or none, if the queue drained before
you could claim). Return ONE block matching one of these shapes:

**On accept:** do ONE `Read` of `.aristo/proofs/<id-with-colons-to-underscores>.proof`
to capture the SDK's stamped TOML form, then return:

```
accepted: <id>  sha256:<hex>
---
<TOML content from the proof file, verbatim>
```

**On reject** (after exhausting up to 2 inline retries):

```
rejected: <id>  <one-line summary>
---
<full stderr from the final failed submit attempt>
```

**On empty pop** (sibling worker drained the queue before you ran):

```
worker exited: queue drained on entry
```

No commentary outside these formats. Each worker returns one block;
the orchestrator aggregates blocks across all completed workers for
the final summary.

## Step 4 — handle each completion notification

When `Agent(run_in_background=true)` notifies you that worker W completed:

1. Decrement `in_flight`.
2. Parse W's return text. Split on the first line containing exactly `---`. Header line first; body after.
3. If the header is `worker exited: queue drained on entry` — no-op (no task was processed); fall through to dispatch decision.
4. If the header starts with `rejected:` — record as a rejection with the body as the failure detail; fall through to dispatch decision.
5. If the header starts with `accepted: <id>  sha256:<hex>` — extract `<id>` and `<hex>`, then run the integrity check: compute `sha256` of the body (the canonical TOML) via `printf '%s' "$body" | shasum -a 256` and compare with the reported hash. Match → record as accepted; keep the body in memory for step 7 (avoids a re-Read). Mismatch → record as rejected with detail "worker reported sha256 does not match returned TOML; on-disk file is still the SDK's write but the returned text cannot be trusted".
6. After recording: check `aristo verify --queue-status`. If `pending > 0`, spawn one replacement worker (in_flight += 1). Otherwise, wait for the next completion notification.

Do NOT write anything yourself. The SDK has already written the file.

## Step 5 — call `aristo verify --apply-verdicts`

Run the SDK's apply step via `Bash`:

```bash
aristo verify --apply-verdicts
```

This invokes the mechanical validator on every `.proof` file in `.aristo/proofs/`. The SDK will:
- accept verdicts whose schema, citation resolution (file exists, lines in range, id in index), and tree structure all pass — flipping status accordingly AND stamping computed hashes into the saved proof file
- reject verdicts that fail any check — printing the failure list to stderr with the proof file path
- exit non-zero if any rejection or parse error

## Step 6 — summary report

Emit a short markdown summary immediately after `--apply-verdicts` returns. Keep this tight; it sets up the interactive review in step 7. Format:

```
## Neural verification results

| Verdict        | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| Verified       | N     |
| Counterexample | N     |
| Inconclusive   | N     |
| Rejected       | N     |

(plus a one-line "why" per rejection, if any)
```

If everything was rejected or there is no accepted content: stop here. There is nothing to walk through.

## Step 7 — interactive review wrapped in a review session

After the summary, offer an interactive walk-through via `AskUserQuestion` — wrapped end-to-end in a **proof-review session** so every decision lands as a substrate-recorded triage state.

### 7.0 Open the session

If step 0 found no active session, start one now:

```bash
aristo session start proof-review --subject "<short description of what was verified>"
```

(If step 0 found a resumable proof-review session, skip this — you're continuing it.)

### 7.1 Opening choice

Ask the user how they want to engage:

```
Question: How would you like to review the results?
Options:
- Walk through all proofs                  — go through each verdict step by step
- Counterexamples only                     — focus on what was refuted
- Inconclusive only                        — focus on suggestions you could accept
- Skip review (defer to backlog)           — `aristo session exit --defer-undecided` (any items you wanted to triage move to the backlog; never silently dropped)
- Abort review entirely                    — `aristo session abort` (destructive; confirmation prompt)
```

If the user picks one of the close options, run that command and stop. The proofs themselves are on disk; they can be reviewed any time via `aristo show <id>` or by reading `.aristo/proofs/<id>.proof`.

### 7.2 Per-proof walkthrough — render the proof in markdown

For each proof in the chosen subset, render it human-readable. Pull the conclusion + steps + grounds from the on-disk `.proof` file (post-apply hashes are stamped, so the file is the source of truth). Format:

```
### Proof: <annotation-id>   (<verdict-type>)

**Claim:** <annotation text>
**Site:** <file>:<site>

**Conclusion:** <proof.conclusion>

**Reasoning:**
1. <step path 0 claim>
   - <ground 1 summary>
   - <ground 2 summary>
   1.1. <step 0.0 claim>  (relation_to_parent)
        - <ground summary>
   ...
```

For counterexamples: render the violation description + the trigger steps similarly.
For inconclusive: render the partial proof (if any) + the gap description + each suggested annotation as a numbered list.

Keep ground summaries short. For code grounds: `crates/x/y.rs:LO-HI — <reason truncated to 80 chars>`. For intent/assume grounds: `intent → <cited-id> — <reason truncated>`.

### 7.3 Per-proof action menu

After rendering each proof, ask the user what to do next. Every option maps to a `aristo session decide --item <ref> --bucket <...>` invocation so the substrate records the triage. Item refs use the proof-review encoding: `<proof_id>#verdict` for proof-level decisions, `<proof_id>#<suggestion_index>` for per-suggestion decisions on inconclusive proofs.

#### Verified verdicts

```
Question: Verified — <annotation-id>. What next?
Options:
- Accept                    — `aristo session decide --item <id>#verdict --bucket accepted` (acknowledges the verdict in the session audit trail)
- Ask a follow-up question  — spawn a Q&A subagent with the proof loaded; loop back here after answering
- Defer (next proof)        — `aristo session decide --item <id>#verdict --bucket pending` (parks for later; appears in next session's backlog)
- Stop review               — `aristo session exit --defer-undecided` (closes the session; any un-decided items go to backlog)
```

If the user asks a follow-up: spawn a fresh `Agent(general-purpose)` with the proof file + the relevant source loaded; relay the user's question; return the answer; loop back to the action menu.

#### Counterexample verdicts

```
Question: Counterexample — <annotation-id>. The proof shows the claim does NOT hold. What next?
Options:
- Fix the code            — make a source edit; then `aristo session decide --item <id>#verdict --bucket accepted --note "fixed in source"`
- Rewrite the intent text — narrow the claim to exclude the failing case; then `aristo session decide --item <id>#verdict --bucket accepted --note "intent narrowed"`
- Reject                  — `aristo session decide --item <id>#verdict --bucket rejected --note "..."` (verdict not actionable — e.g., counterexample is in a deprecated path)
- Defer                   — `aristo session decide --item <id>#verdict --bucket pending` (leave as Counterexample; loud warning on every `aristo stamp` keeps it visible)
```

On **Fix the code**: read the violated step, propose a specific edit (Edit tool — show the diff first via the question's `preview` field if reasonable). Confirm via a second `AskUserQuestion` before applying. After applying: record the decide. `aristo stamp` happens AFTER the session closes (the guard blocks it during the session).

On **Rewrite the intent text**: read the current intent text from the source file, propose a narrowed version, confirm via `AskUserQuestion` with the new text in `preview`. Apply via Edit. Record the decide. `aristo stamp` after close.

On **Defer**: the substrate records this as `pending`; the counterexample stays loud on `aristo stamp` regardless (per `aristo stamp`'s built-in counterexample warning).

#### Inconclusive verdicts

This is the case the user specifically called out. **Every suggested annotation gets surfaced as an actionable question.** Each suggestion has its own item ref `<id>#<suggestion_index>`.

```
Question: Inconclusive — <annotation-id>. The verifier suggests <N> annotation(s) that could close the gap. Pick one:
Options:
- Add suggestion 1: <kind> at <site> — "<truncated text>..."
- Add suggestion 2: <kind> at <site> — "<truncated text>..."   (if exists)
- Add suggestion 3: <kind> at <site> — "<truncated text>..."   (if exists; AskUserQuestion supports max 4)
- Skip — defer all                     — `aristo session decide --item <id>#verdict --bucket pending` (parks the whole proof for later)
```

Use `preview` on each option to show the full suggested text (multi-line, with the file/site context). The user picks one (or "Other" for a custom variant of the suggestion).

On **Add suggestion N**: edit the source file at the suggested `at_site` to insert the new `#[aristo::intent(...)]` or `#[aristo::assume(...)]` annotation with the suggested text. Show the proposed edit (file path + new lines) and confirm via a second `AskUserQuestion` before applying. After applying: record `aristo session decide --item <id>#<N> --bucket accepted --note "added"`. Also record the OTHER suggestions on the same proof as rejected (with notes) so the substrate's fingerprint captures the per-suggestion judgment. `aristo stamp` after the session closes.

If a proof has more than 3 suggestions: present the first 3 as direct options + a 4th option "Show all suggestions" that re-prompts with the next batch.

On **Skip — defer all**: records the proof-level defer; suggestions stay in the proof file. The validator's suggestion-vs-index check (see `validator_rejects_inconclusive_when_suggestion_is_in_index`) means IF the user later adds an annotation matching one of the suggestions, the entry auto-re-pends.

### 7.4 Closing the session

When all proofs are decided OR the user picks "Stop review (defer remaining)":

- **All decided** → `aristo session exit` (strict close).
- **Stopped early** → `aristo session exit --defer-undecided` (un-decided items move to backlog; never silently dropped).

Print the closing summary line (SDK emits one already). If any source edits were made: remind the user the affected entries are now Stale and will re-pend on the next `aristo verify` / `/aristo-neural-verify` cycle. Run `aristo stamp` AFTER closing the session (the guard blocks it during the session).

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does NOT write `.aristo/proofs/<id>.proof` files directly — neither this orchestrator nor the spawned subagents have Write-tool access to that directory. The SDK is the sole writer, via `aristo verify --submit-verdict`.
- It does NOT modify `.aristo/index.toml` directly. The SDK does that via `--apply-verdicts`.
- It does NOT auto-fix rejected verdicts beyond the subagent's two inline retries. The user reviews further failures first.
- It does NOT call any LLM-as-judge between the verdict and the validator. The validator is purely mechanical; that's the design.
- It does NOT compute ground hashes. The SDK does that mechanically on accept.
- It does NOT touch source code unprompted. Source edits only happen as a direct result of a user choice in step 7 (accept suggestion, fix code, rewrite intent) — and every such edit is confirmed via a second `AskUserQuestion` showing the diff before it lands.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Granting `Write` (or any other file-mutation tool) to a spawned subagent. Subagents are Bash + Read only; the submit-verdict CLI is the single write path.
- ❌ Spawning subagents with the same context already polluted by earlier verdicts. Each subagent must be a fresh `Agent(...)` call.
- ❌ Re-writing the SDK's pending file. The SDK regenerates it on the next `aristo verify` run.
- ❌ Including `code_text_hash` or `at_text_hash` in any ground — the validator computes and stamps them. Any value you write will be ignored at best and rejected at worst.
- ❌ Citing an intent or assume id you didn't find verbatim in the loaded `.aristo/index.toml`. The validator will reject "cited id not found in current index" and waste your repair budget.
- ❌ Using `relation_to_parent = "supports"` (or any value not in the exact five-variant list). Same for `"supports"` as a ground `relation`.
- ❌ Using `prior-step` to reference a CHILD path (e.g., step `"0"` citing `"0.0"` as prior-step). Prior-step is for siblings and uncles; parent→child wiring is `subgoal_paths` + `composition`.
- ❌ Citing code line ranges that exceed actual file length (`"1-200"` for a 40-line file). The validator computes file length and rejects out-of-range citations.
- ❌ Returning a verdict on behalf of the user ("this seems verified to me"). The subagent is the only authority; you (this skill) orchestrate, you do not judge.
- ❌ **Walking through every proof verbatim without offering choices.** The interactive review only earns its keep when the user can actually act. Dumping all proofs to the chat is just noise.
- ❌ **Editing source without explicit confirmation.** Even when the user picks "Add suggestion 1", the actual `Edit` call only happens after a second `AskUserQuestion` that shows the proposed change. Skipping that step turns a typo into a silent regression.
- ❌ **Bulk-accepting all suggestions in one go.** Each suggestion is its own decision. If the user wants to accept many, they navigate through; the skill doesn't offer a single "accept all" option (too easy to land junk).
